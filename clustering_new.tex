\section{GEM clustering - post-2019 analysis}
\label{clustering_new}

{\em The new clustering algorithm itself is in development. For the moment this section just means to put on the table what ideas can be realized.}

This section describes the new GEM decoding analysis we set up after the realization that the old clustering method described in section~\ref{clustering} was suffering inefficiencies.
One of the features we want to exploit is the correlation in time and amplitude between both readout coordinates. We also want to exploit the relatively well known shape of the spread avalanche.
The main challenge is that we want to consider clusters, and not strips, as the first degrees of freedom, but we still have to deal with strips as they are the only information we have available from the DAQ.

\subsection{Initial ideas}

An option could be to scan the strips in both coordinates, and start to group together strips with a similar sampling pattern (indicating a similar time). If two strips with a similar sampling pattern and a detectable (but not {\em large}) signal are separated with one strip which does not seem to show this same pattern, the middle strip should be integrated into the cluster nonetheless.\\
Indeed the signal amplitude we could have for the proton in GEp could be fairly small, and it is fairly easy for a strip to be distorted enough by the pedestal that we can hardly match its sampling pattern with the others.\\
While scanning the strips, if we scan at least a couple strips with a similar sampling pattern, the one with the maximal amplitude should be considered as the ``center'' of the hit, and the limits of the hit could be extended to the few neighboring strips.\\
After obtaining such patterns in both coordinates, those would have to be associated together based on time and amplitude criteria (one criterion could take precedence the other, e.g. time on amplitude). The hits in each projection shall be retained only if the have found a match on the other coordinate.
{\em Assuming this is the way to go, how to handle background ?}\\
%, to evaluate their time and ADC maxima. Then, one would match (within some tolerence to be defined) the strips with 

Another option might be to scan the strips and retain the local ADC maxima with times on both coordinates. After obtaining these ADC maxima on both coordinates, one should match them coordinate to coordinate, and build the hits from the successfully matched strips using the typical avalanche profile.

\subsection{Hall~C clustering algorithm spin-off}

The Hall~C clustering algorithm first checks for a ``cluster'' (a peak with two shoulders in this context) time sample by time sample, for strips passing a lower threshold.
Afterwards, it rejects the hits that are not passing a higher threshold, which is something we do not want (because we will rule out most of our signal).
Then, the ``individual time sample clusters'' are looked for in the other time clusters. If they are found in enough consecutive samples, then the times samples are fitted with a peak function.
In our case, we might want to allow for two missing samples out of six.
